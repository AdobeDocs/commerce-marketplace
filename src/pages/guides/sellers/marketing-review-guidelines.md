# Marketing review guidelines

From a marketing perspective, all submissions to Commerce Marketplace must solve a business problem and deliver rich and unique functionality. Marketing descriptions will be checked against our style guidelines to make sure that content is in line with our branding guidelines.

## Presentation: Make the first impression count

We have made an investment in the presentation of Commerce Marketplace. In return, we ask that you put forth an effort to present your solutions in a professional manner. If we see room for improvement, we'll reach out to you before adding your product to Commerce Marketplace.

*  Your product must have a professional presentation with clear descriptions, images, and screenshots.
*  The product name must indicate the purpose of the extension or theme.
*  The product description must be well-written and provide an overview of the features and benefits.
*  Use only high-quality screenshots, images, and video to accompany the listing.

## Product title

The product title should fulfill the following guidelines:

*  Choose a title that is descriptive and concise. The title can be up to five words in length and must be in English.
*  Do not include the version number, developer name, or any reference to Adobe or Magento in the title.
   *  Do not use _Magento_ or _M2_.
*  Do not include the words _Extension_, _Module_ or _Plugin_.
   *  The words, _Connector_ and _Integration_ can be used if applicable.
*  Use _&_ instead of _And_, such as in _Order & Save_ (not _Order and Save_).
*  Capitalize the first letter of each word, such as _Mass Order Export_ (not _Mass order export_).
   *  Do not use all capital letters.
*  Do not use punctuation unless it's part of the actual company name, such as _InstantSearch+_ or _Yahoo!_.
   *  _/_ and _-_ are acceptable in certain circumstances, such as for _Two-Factor_ or _Import / Export_.
*  Do not add underscores between words in the package name, such as (_Extension_Title_).
*  Do not use the Developer Name in the title, such as _Print Order PDF_ (not _Fooman Print Order PDF_).
   *  If the developer is the same name as the service being integrated, you may use the develop name in the title. For instance, if Visa submits an integration, they should include _Visa_ since it's the name of the service.
*  You can add the Commerce version, such as 2.4, if two separate extensions must be on the store.

## Product icon

The product icon should fulfill the following guidelines:

*  The icon must reflect the listing with words and/or images. Text is not required, but an title can be added to the icon.
   *  If the title is added to the icon, it should exactly match the title of the product.
   *  No slogans or features.
*  Do not use _Adobe_, _Magento_, or _M2_.
*  Do not use the Adobe or Magento Logo.
*  Do not use the developer logo instead of the extension icon.
*  Do not specify the listing version.
*  Limit the use of the word _Pro_.
*  Less is more. Avoid minute detail that is hard to understand.
*  For first-party companies, we recommend using the same image you use on Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.

## Long description

For guides and examples of long descriptions, see [product descriptions](product-descriptions.md).

## User guide, reference manual, or installation guide

Product documentation should fulfill the following guidelines:

*  Must cover all features of the product.
*  Must not direct users to make purchases on sites other than Marketplace.
*  If a product title is added into the documentation, it must not include _Adobe Commerce_ or _Magento Open Source_. Use _For Adobe Commerce_ or _For Magento Open Source_ after the title if needed.
*  Use of the Adobe or Magento logo is prohibited. To learn more, see our [branding guidelines](branding.md).
   *  Partners can use their Adobe partner badge.
*  At least one piece of uploaded documentation must be in English.
*  Do not upload duplicates of the documents.

## Pricing: Provide clear pricing information

The price of your extension is included as part of the marketing information. To learn more, see [pricing information](submit-for-marketing-review.md#pricing-information).

*  Items listed on the Commerce Marketplace can be offered for free or sold as commercial products.
*  The price of items offered for sale on the Commerce Marketplace can range anywhere from $25.00 to $999,999.00, and must reflect fair market value.

*  Any additional fees or subscription pricing—including fees charged by a third-party company for integrated services—must be included in the opening paragraph of the Long Description with bold formatting.
*  We recommend $99 for Open Source and $199 for Commerce extension pricing.

## Content: Complete the product profile

The content that accompanies your listing is derived from the [marketing information](submit-for-marketing-review.md) you entered for the extension, app or theme, and information in your company profile. To learn more, see [Listing content](content.md).

*  All content that is associated with a Commerce Marketplace listing must be free of offensive or discriminatory language, sexual content, or nudity.

## Branding: Use Magento name and logo correctly

The Magento name and its related logos are trademarks owned by Adobe. Your extension and listing must not violate the trademarks and copyrights of Magento, Adobe, or those of any other party. To learn more, see [branding](branding.md).
