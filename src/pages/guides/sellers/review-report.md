## Troubleshooting

This section provides troubleshooting tips for common issues.

### Package stability

The following error message means that you are using an `alpha` value for the package, which is not supported, and cannot be installed on the Commerce platform:

```text
Stability is not valid. Allowed values are: "stable, beta".
```

To resolve this issue, change the stability value to `stable` or `beta` in the `package.xml` file under `stability`.
