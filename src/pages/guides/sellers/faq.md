# Frequently asked questions

Get answers to common questions about selling apps and extensions on the Adobe Commerce Marketplace.

1. How do I remove product reviews?

   Only the author (buyer) of a review has the authority to request its removal. While the developer/seller can request the buyer to retract the review, the final decision rests solely with the buyer.

1. How do I refresh my cloud sandbox?

   See [Reset environment on cloud](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/how-to/reset-environment-on-cloud) in the Adobe Commerce Support Knowledge Base.

1. What do I do with a stuck deployment?

   See [Deployment troubleshooter](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/troubleshooting/deployment/magento-deployment-troubleshooter) in the Adobe Commerce Support Knowledge Base.

1. Where/how do I get more help if needed?

   See the [Adobe Commerce Support Knowledge Base](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/overview).

1. Where/how do solution partners or tech partners submit a support request?

   - Solution partners can submit a support request through the [Adobe Solution Partner Program](https://solutionpartners.adobe.com/solution-partners/home.html).
   - Tech partners can submit a support request on the [Marketplace Help Center](https://marketplacesupport.magento.com/hc/en-us).

1. How do I change my vendor name?

   After your account is set up with a vendor name, and your apps and extensions have been launched and sold on the Marketplace, the vendor name cannot be changed. For more information on how the vendor name is used, see [profile information](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/marketplace/guides/sellers/profile-information/#company).

1. What payment methods does the Marketplace support?

   The Marketplace accepts PayPal from any country that supports that payment option. Make sure that the PayPal email address matches the Marketplace login email to avoid any purchasing issues.
