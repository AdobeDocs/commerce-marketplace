# Account setup process

The following sections describe the account setup process.

## Step 1: Log in or register for a developer account

If you have an existing Commerce account, simply log in and complete the [developer registration](developer-register.md) process. If you are new to Adobe Commerce, you can sign up for a new account and register as a developer at the same time.

All general developer accounts begin with default settings that only allow Open Source (CE) submissions. To submit Adobe Commerce extensions (EE), the account owner must be a partner or request an Adobe Commerce developer license. You must use the same email address as the developer portal account.

## Step 2: Agree to the terms of service

Read the Commerce Marketplace [master](https://commercemarketplace.adobe.com/legal/terms/master-terms) and [developer](https://commercemarketplace.adobe.com/legal/terms/development-terms) terms of service. Then, select the checkbox to agree with the terms and continue.

## Step 3: Complete your personal profile

The information in your [personal profile](developer-register.md) identifies you as an individual vendor in Commerce Marketplace, and includes your background, image, contact information, and social network addresses.

## Step 4: Complete your company profile

Your [account information](./profile-information.md) is similar to your personal profile, and provides the information about your company and brand that appears in your Commerce Marketplace listing.
