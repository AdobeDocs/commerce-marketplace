# Extension Quality Program

The Extension Quality Program (EQP) combines Adobe Commerce expertise, development guidelines, and verification tools to ensure that all extensions and other listings on Commerce Marketplace meet our coding standards and best practices.

The review process includes both an automated check and manual QA review. During the process, the structure and code of each listing is examined and tested for evidence of virus/malware infection, and any indication of plagiarism. The review includes a deep technical examination and sanity check conducted by the Marketplace team, with a focus on documentation, coding structure, performance, scalability, security, and compatibility with the Adobe Commerce core.

You can log in to your Marketplace account to check the status of your submission. If your submission does not pass our technical or marketing reviews, we will tell you why, and how to fix it. Otherwise, your successful submissions will be listed on Marketplace.

## Create a listing

When your code is ready to be submitted to uploaded to Commerce Marketplace, create the listing in Commerce Marketplace.

*  [Apps](app-create.md)
*  [Extensions](extension-create.md)
*  [Themes](themes.md)
*  [Shared packages](shared-packages.md)

## Submit for review

The [review process](submit-for-review.md) has two phases:

During [Technical Review](submit-for-technical-review.md), your code is scanned and validated via automated testing and manual QA.

During [Marketing Review](submit-for-marketing-review.md), your marketing information (including the documentation and images) is examined for quality and to make sure that it meets our marketing guidelines.

If the code doesn't pass either review, you can correct the problem and [resubmit](extension-resubmit.md) it.

## Approval

When your [code passes](sales.md) Technical Review and Marketing Review, it is approved and released for publication on the Commerce Marketplace.
