# Define the business value

Marketplace listings with a clearly stated business value are easy for us to promote, and easy for customers to find.

## Utility

-  All listings should address a business need by solving an issue or enhancing existing functionality.
-  Any listing that does not serve a useful purpose will be rejected.

## Relevancy

-  Create an app or extension that addresses a specific business case or solves a common problem faced by merchants.
-  Take a survey to see what extensions and apps are already available on Commerce Marketplace.
-  Differentiate your extension or app from other solutions. Be innovative, and do not copy ideas from other developers.

## Pricing

-  Items listed on Commerce Marketplace can be offered for free, or sold as commercial products.
-  Items offered for sale on Commerce Marketplace must reflect fair market value. The minimum price for a paid, flat fee extension is $25. The minimum price for a subscription is $10. If the extension is also available for sale on your site, the prices must be the same.
-  All purchases are paid for in US currency.
-  Items sold on Commerce Marketplace are subject to a revenue sharing fee that is paid by the developer.

Adobe will waive commissions on all apps submitted to the marketplace in 2023 for the first two years of listing. Adobe reserves the right to charge a commission on apps submitted after 2023 as well as for apps submitted in 2023 after the initial two year period. The commission model for apps will be communicated at a later date.

## Appeal

-  Create an extension that has broad appeal.
-  Your extension might be rejected if it appeals to only a small number of merchants.

## Promotion

-  We will do our best to put your extension in front of merchants, but we need your help!
-  Be your own cheerleader.
-  Create case studies that show the traction you have with merchants, and tell success stories of merchants who use your extension.
-  Establish yourself as a strong partner. Work closely with the Marketplace team to help us highlight your work.
-  If there is an apparent lack of interest in your extension, we will review any issues with you. If after a period of time the level of interest does not improve, the extension might be removed from Commerce Marketplace.
