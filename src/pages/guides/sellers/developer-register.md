## Step 1: Create a developer account

1. Access your account.

   If you don't yet have a Adobe Commerce Marketplace account, do one of the following:

   -  Go to the [Developer Portal](https://commercedeveloper.adobe.com) page, and click **Create  Account**. Then, click **Register**.
   -  In the upper-right corner of [Commerce Marketplace](https://commercemarketplace.adobe.com), click **Sign In**. Then, click **Register**.
   -  From [business.adobe.com](https://business.adobe.com/), click **My Account**. Then under **New Customers**, click **Register**.

   If you already have an account, log in as a registered user.

   1. Click **Marketplace** and choose **Developer Portal**.

   1. Under _Personal Information_, enter your **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Email Address**, and **Country**.

      If there is already an account associated with this email address, click the link to access your account.

   1. Under _My Company Primarily_, choose the best description of your company's primary focus. Then, set **My Role** to the option that best describes what you do for the company.

   1. Under _Login Information_, enter a **Password** for your account. Then, enter it again to confirm.

      Your password can be from eight- to sixteen-characters long, and must include at least one capital letter, one number, and either one special character or one lowercase letter.

   1. Select the **Terms of Service** checkbox and clickÂ **Submit**.

## Step 2: Agree to the terms of service

Read the following documents that describe Commerce Marketplace terms of service.

-  [Commerce Marketplace Master Terms](https://commercemarketplace.adobe.com/legal/terms/master-terms)
-  [Commerce Marketplace Development Terms](https://commercemarketplace.adobe.com/legal/terms/development-terms)

If you agree with the terms of use, select the checkbox and click **I Agree**.

## Step 3: Select the type of account

Your Commerce Marketplace developer account can be set up as an individual or company. All listings that are developed by a single company should be managed under the same account.

When prompted, select the type of account you want to create, and click **Choose**. Then, follow the [Profile Information](./profile-information.md) instructions to complete the profile for the account.
