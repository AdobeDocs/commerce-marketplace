# Submit for technical review overview

All products submitted to Commerce Marketplace must pass the technical review as part of the submission workflow. For all product types except apps, the technical review process is automated. For apps, this process is manual.

Technical review helps to improve the quality of products on Commerce Marketplace by checking for indications of plagiarism, malware, and adherence to Adobe coding standards. Developers whose submissions do not pass technical review receive a report of the results. After the issues are resolved, you are welcome to resubmit the product. Submissions must pass technical review to receive a listing on Commerce Marketplace.

When your [submission form](extension-information.md) is complete, you can submit your product for technical review. During the process, we review the code according to [technical guidelines](technical-review-guidelines.md), install and use the product according to your documentation, and verify specifics from your submission form. You can track the status and progress of your submission through your Marketplace account.

The following instructions show how to submit an extension for technical review. The process is essentially the same for [themes](themes.md) and [shared packages](shared-packages.md).

<InlineAlert variant="info" slots="text"/>

**Important - Shared Packages**: If your extension uses [shared packages](shared-packages.md) (or components), the packages must be ready and associated with your submission. You will not be able to submit your extension to technical review until the shared packages are available in your account.

## Prepare for technical review

Before submitting a product for marketing review, conduct your own internal review of the content to make sure that it is ready for publication.

-  Review the [technical](technical-review-guidelines.md) guidelines to ensure that your submission meets Commerce Marketplace and Magento development requirements.
-  For theme extensions, verify all image, css, and code assets correctly load on the storefront. For feature / service extensions, make sure data and options follow coding standards, logging, etc.
-  All extensions and apps must be secure, without viruses, malware, or vulnerabilities.
-  Fully test your product, including installation, dependencies, shared packages, configuration, and usage.

### Terms and conditions

All products and services are subject to the same Commerce Marketplace terms and conditions that are communicated to developers upon submission, and to merchants upon the purchase of any product or service. A separate licensing agreement is not required. However, you can include additional terms and conditions as follows:

-  Create a workflow that requires the merchant to accept the terms and conditions when the extension or app is installed.
-  Place a link to the separate agreement in the extension or app description.

## Step 1: Enter technical submission details

1. Log into the Marketplace Developer Portal, and then click **Apps**, **Extensions**, **Themes**, or **Shared Packages**.

1. Click the listing name you want to submit.

    The **Technical Submission** page loads. You can save progress and reopen this page to submit when you are ready.

1. Click **Attach Package** to upload the listing code package.

    For complete package guidelines, see [Package a component](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/php/development/package/component/).

1. For **Magento Version Compatibility**, select the supported version number and compatibility for the extension.

    The listed options include all minor versions Adobe Commerce supports at time of submission.

1. Select the Licensing options.

    This option requires the user to agree to a license in addition to the terms and conditions. You have two options:

    -  Choose a License Type - Select a license type provided from the drop-down menu.

    -  Enter a Custom License - Enter the name and URL location for your custom license, available from a public website.

1. Add Documentation and Resources for your extension.

    Commerce Marketplace tests and reviews documentation during the technical review. You can add additional documentation during the [marketing review](submit-for-marketing-review.md).

    You must include **at least one** of the following, in PDF format (less than 5MB):

    -  Attach User Guide - Documentation describing how to configure and use your listing's features in the Admin and any other screens.
    -  Attach Reference Manual - Documentation detailing fields, screens, and workflows for the added features, screens, and fields in the Admin.
    -  Attach Installation Guide - Documentation instructing how to install and configure the listing on your instance.

1. Follow the same steps to upload a reference manual or installation guide.

1. If other components are used by a Commerce extension, select the relevant **Shared Package**.

   **Important:** Before a shared package can be linked to an extension, it must be submitted for review and must receive the status **Ready to Use**.

1. Enter **Release Notes** for your extension.

    This preliminary draft can be formatted with simple HTML and can include text, numbers, symbols, and spaces.

1. When complete, submit the product or save to continue progress later. To enter the queue, you must click **Submit**.

## Step 2: Submit the product for technical review

1. When the required fields are complete, click **Submit**.

1. In the **Confirm Your Technical Submission** box, click **Cancel** to go back to the submission details, or click **Confirm** to submit the extension.

    It might take a few minutes for your package to upload. You will receive email confirmation when the package is submitted for technical review. You will also be notified when the review is complete.

## After submission

1. If you have not submitted the [marketing review](submit-for-marketing-review.md), complete those steps to submission.

1. Watch your email for feedback and updates for the technical review.

1. Check the Test Reports posted for your submission through the Developer portal.

1. If issues, errors, or changes are required, you will receive an email failure notification. The submission will be in a failed state. When those issues are resolved, re-submit the package for review.
