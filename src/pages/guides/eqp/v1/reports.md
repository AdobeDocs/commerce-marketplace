# Reports

Several types of reports are available.

## User Reports

See the related section under [users](users.md#user-reports) for more information.

## Product Submission Reports

Products go through several reviews before being released on the Commerce Marketplace.  The results of these reviews typically contain detailed reports.  See the section on [test results](test-results.md).

## Marketplace Reports

This resource provides information on aggregated reports across the Marketplace sites. It may include aggregated metrics on overall page views, category-specific page views, EQP process-related metrics and more.
