# Marketplace EQP API

The **Commerce Marketplace Extension Quality Program ([EQP](../../sellers/extension-quality-program.md)) REST API** provides access to the [Marketplace Developer Portal][1].

The **Marketplace Developer Portal** provides you the capability to do the following:

-  Publish your product's marketing information on the [Commerce Marketplace][3]. As a result, your customers can find and purchase each of your products.
-  Publish your individual or company profile on the **Commerce Marketplace**, making it easy for your customers to learn more about you and your company.
-  Upload your code for your Magento 2 extensions, themes, and shared packages to the **Magento Product Repository**. After your customers purchase your product,  your customers can download your code.
-  Access your sales reports. Get aggregated metrics on overall page views, category-specific page views, EQP process-related metrics and more.
